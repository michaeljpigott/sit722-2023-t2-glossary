# sit722-2023-t2-glossary

This project is part of my completion of SIT722 - Software Deployment and Operation at Deakin University.

It is a simple express web server that presents a glossary of terms that I learn during this semester.

It is using Bootstrap CSS for styling.

I also used application-side JavaScript to reformat links and paragraphs.

Test push.
